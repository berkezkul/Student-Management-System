Press 2 to sort students by grade point average: This option displays a sorted order by students' grade point averages.

Press 3 to view students by data structures grades: This option shows students sorted by their data structures grade.

Press 4 to view students by math averages: This option shows students sorted by their math grade point average.

Press 5 to see the student with the lowest data structures grade: This option shows the user the student with the lowest data structures grade.

Press 6 to delete the student with the ID number you entered: This option deletes the student with the ID number the user entered from the list.

Press 7 to add a new student: This option provides the user with an interface to add a new student.

Press 8 to find out the number of students: This option displays the number of students in the list to the user.
